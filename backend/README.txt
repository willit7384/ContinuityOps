ContinuityOps – Backend

Backend service for ContinuityOps, a student admissions and enrollment platform focused on secure

---

Prisma Schema

```prisma
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "mysql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id         String   @id @default(uuid())
  email      String   @unique
  password   String
  firstName  String
  lastName   String
  role       Role     @default(STUDENT)
  createdAt  DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
}

enum Role {
  STUDENT
  COUNSELOR
  ADMIN
}
```

---

 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:password@localhost:3306/continuityops"
```

> `.env` is gitignored and should never be committed.

---

Development Setup

 Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

 Generate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

 Run Migrations

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

 Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Server runs on:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

API (Current)

 Auth Routes

```
POST /api/auth/register
POST /api/auth/login
```

Auth logic is currently scaffolded and will be expanded with hashing, validation, and JWT.

---

Security Notes (Planned)

 Password hashing with bcrypt
 JWT-based session auth
 Role-based route protection
 Input validation (Zod or Joi)
 Prisma-level query safety

---

Roadmap

 [ ] Complete auth (hashing + JWT)
 [ ] Role-based middleware
 [ ] Student enrollment workflow
 [ ] Counselor/admin dashboards
 [ ] Audit logging
 [ ] Docker + shadow DB (later)

---

Status

Backend boots successfully
Auth in progress
Database local MySQL

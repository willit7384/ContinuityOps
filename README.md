# ContinuityOps
I built ContinuityOps, a lightweight internal workflow tool for tracking critical IT systems, managing incidents, and generating recovery tasks. It’s fully async, backed by MySQL, and Dockerized for consistent deployment. The project demonstrates my ability to translate operational workflows into software solutions.

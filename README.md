# ContinuityOps
I built ContinuityOps, a lightweight internal workflow tool for tracking critical IT systems, managing incidents, and generating recovery tasks. It’s fully async, backed by MySQL, and Dockerized for consistent deployment. The project demonstrates my ability to translate operational workflows into software solutions.

Project Overview – “Internal workflow automation for IT continuity”

Problem Statement – “Tracking critical systems and managing incidents efficiently”

Tech Stack – Node.js, Express, async/await, MySQL, React, Docker

Architecture Diagram – Visual async workflow diagram

Features – List all tables + modules

Setup Instructions – Docker build/run, ports, env vars

Screenshots – Dashboard, incident form, recovery tasks

Optional Notes – “Inspired by BCP/BIA coursework, applied concepts to software workflows”

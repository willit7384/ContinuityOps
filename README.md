# ContinuityOps
I built ContinuityOps, a lightweight internal enterprise workflow tool made for a simulated university called DataU. This tool is made for  student and faculty account management purposes. It’s fully async, backed by MySQL, and Dockerized for consistent deployment. The project demonstrates my ability to translate operational workflows into software solutions.
